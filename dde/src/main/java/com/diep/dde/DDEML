1. Dynamic Data Exchange Management Library (DDEML)
*  provides an interface that simplifies the task of adding DDE capability to an application
instead of sending, posting, processing DDE messages directly

* Allow server app to register service name and broadcast to system.
Other apps can use the name to connect to server

* Manage shared memory using string handles (to identify string) and data handles (to identify memory object),
instead of atoms and pointers

* to use DDEML, you must
    include DDEML.h header file in your source files
    link with USER32.LIB file
    ensure that DDEML.dll file resides in the system's path

2. JDDE
JNI-based free open source Java lib for Java apps to communicate with native app on Windows platform via DDE
