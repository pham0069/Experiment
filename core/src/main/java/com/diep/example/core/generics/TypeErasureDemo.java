package com.diep.example.core.generics;

/**
 * Generics were introduced to the Java language to:
 * 1. provide tighter type checks at compile time
 * 2. and support generic programming.
 *
 * To implement generics, the Java compiler applies type erasure to:
 * 1. Replace all type parameters in generic types with their bounds or Object,
 * if the type parameters are unbounded.
 * The produced bytecode, therefore, contains only ordinary classes, interfaces, and methods.
 * 2. Insert type casts if necessary to preserve type safety.
 * 3. Generate bridge methods to preserve polymorphism in extended generic types.
 *
 * Type erasure ensures that no new classes are created for parameterized types;
 * consequently, generics incur no runtime overhead.
 * =====================================================================================================================
 * A reifiable type is a type whose type information is fully available at runtime.
 * This includes primitives, non-generic types, raw types, and invocations of unbound wildcards.
 *
 * Non-reifiable types are types where information has been removed at compile-time by type erasure
 * â€” invocations of generic types that are not defined as unbounded wildcards.
 * A non-reifiable type does not have all of its information available at runtime.
