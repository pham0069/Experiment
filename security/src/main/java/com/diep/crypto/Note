1. Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
JCE used to be separate from Java platform due to US restriction
Strongest security algorithms are only available to US company
Others need to implement their own or use weaker algorithm

2. Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)
Security implementations are provided by providers
You can implement your own provider but could be bound to security holes
Better use built-in provider or use well-established provider like Bouncy Castle

3. Provider
To use Java crypto API, u need Provider set
By default, Java SDK provider is used

4. Key security
Keys should be hard to guess so an attacker cannot easily guess the encryption key.
If they key is easy to guess, it is easy for an attacker to decrypt the encrypted data
and possibly create fake messages herself.

It is important to make a key hard to guess. Thus, a key should consist of random bytes.
The more random, the better, and the more bytes,
the harder to guess because there are more possible combinations.
